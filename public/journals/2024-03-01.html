I didn't anything special but still felt good. :)
Except studing at night while listening to music. And yeah I met this person from india at discord. They were nice and in the middle of thier Board exam. Strangely they were preparing for their maths exam while chatting. Mabey it's like a fidgit activity they do while doing maths like I listen to music.
I got the uni's notes from my friend and there is gonna be two quizes, better get working on them.
And lecture notes, sunday is filled ;(
