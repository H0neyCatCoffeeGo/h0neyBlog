** My Ramadan
Ramadan oficially started from today, we are going to do saher tonight and fasting starts tommorow. After my departure from my faith this is going to be my first ever Ramadan and my feelings are still surprosingly positive about the month. Yeah, I am not going to be fasting for the 1400 pedophile but the idea of fasting not just from food but also from all forms of bodiely urges is something worth considering. As I am living with my family it's out of the question to not fast, so I am going to do ramadan like it's actually supposed to be done.
Leaving all of my bodiely desires for a month of liking like a stoic.
And I got my ID card. :)
